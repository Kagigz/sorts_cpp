# Sorts (C++ Implementation)

My implementation of well-known sorts in C++ (on vector<int>), with the execution time.

Sorts added for now:
- Quick sort
- Merge sort

## Test it

1. Clone or download the project

2. Open Sorts.cpp

3. Use the vector of your choice: use one of the examples, add one, or ask the user to enter values

4. Test the sort of your choice (/!\ if you want to test several at the same time, change the names of the vectors)
